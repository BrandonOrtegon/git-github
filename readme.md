# Git Lesson

- version control systemn created by Linus Torvalds in 2005
- allows multiple developers to contribute to the same codebase
- That codebase or project is called a repository (repo for short)

## How to use Git

- **in the folder in which you intend to create a project** initialize a new git repository
- initialize a new repository using `git init` command
- in order to track files, use `git add <name of file>` to track a file

- the default branch is called the `main` branch or `master`
- commit - a snapshot of your code at a specific point in time
